# Jellytorrent -- a BitTorrent Client & ...?

## Supported features:
Planning to do http, https, udp 


## Development timeline status:<br>
| Time & Date | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 05/23/2023 | planning stage, using CPython 3.10.6 |

## Style guides
Yes, I added the prefix jelly for every Python module name. Please don't judge if you attempt to.<br> 

I will stick to using double quotes for strings, dictionary keys, etc...until I have to use single quotes..<br>
